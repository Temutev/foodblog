### Ingredients

What you will need:

- 3 cups of all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1Â½ cups of warm water

What to do:

1. Mix the flour, sugar and salt in a big bowl. Add margarine (optional) and mix with your hands
2. Make a well and pour water in bits as you knead. Continue kneading for about 5 minutes. If the dough is sticky, you can add flour in bits until you get the perfect texture
3. Place the dough on a work surface (on top of the table) and continue to thoroughly need for about 3 minutes
4. The end product should be a firm but soft and not sticky dough. Cover it with a dump cloth, cling film or polythene for about 20 to 30 minutes
5. After the 30 minutes, knead again and cut the dough into small balls
   Use a rolling pin, roll out the balls into circular shapes, one at a time and brush with oil
6. Then fold them into circular knots and then cover them
   Now pick them, one at time (the rest remaining covered) and roll out again
7. In medium heat, place your pan (tava) and let it warm up
   Then place your rolled out chapatti on the tava and fry both sides until brown as you occasionally brush with oil
8. Once cooked place in a container and cover as you continue cooking
9. Repeat until all your rolls are cooked
